# Government Requests From Meta on a Rise
# Data Project Assignment 3 

This is my submission for Lede 2023 project 1, where I took open-source data, analyzed it through pandas, and visualized it using Datawrapper. My topic focuses on the transparency reports that Meta publishes, taking a closer look into the trends of these requests globally. 

My aim was to uncover the trends of government requests filed in the past year and ascertain whether the requests have seen a hike or not. I also planned to see a rise in legal, preservation, and emergency requests and what that means for the users. 

 Here are the CSV files: 

* [Total Requests in 2020- Top 10 countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/TotalR20.csv)
* [Total Requests in 2022 - Top 10 countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/TotalR.csv)
* [Emergency Requests in 2022 - Top 10 Countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/Emergency.csv)

The data indicates a rise in government requests from Meta and further research also supports the rise. In fact, there were over 400k requests made in 2022, as per research done by atlasVPN. The data also shows a rise in emergency requests issued by the countries. My findings also show that the United States and India are consistently filing the highest requests to Meta followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

The data analysis process included removing commas to sort the data and picking out the top 10 countries.

## Skills learned: 
That book knowledge is indeed different from practical knowledge, and this assignment is a prime example of that. I learned and relearned the basics of analyzing in Pandas, using GitHub and visualization in Datawrapper during this assignment. I also learned to find interesting data sets that are available to the public and make sense of them using pandas. 

## Things I would've liked to do:
I aim to get into more complex comparisons and want to compare each type of request (legal, emergency, and preservation) with previous years' data, from 2016.
