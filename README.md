# Government Requests From Meta on a Rise
# Data Project Assignment 3 

This is my submission for Lede 2023 project 1, where I took open-source data, analyzed it through pandas, and visualized it using Datawrapper. My topic focuses on the transparency reports that Meta publishes, taking a closer look into the trends of these requests globally. 

 Here are the CSV files: 

* [Total Requests in 2020- Top 10 countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/TotalR20.csv)
* [Total Requests in 2022 - Top 10 countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/TotalR.csv)
* [Emergency Requests in 2022 - Top 10 Countries](https://github.com/PrachiVashishtt/Vashisht_Meta_Lede/blob/main/Emergency.csv)

The data indicates a rise in government requests from Meta and further research also supports the rise. In fact, there were over 400k requests made in 2022, as per research done by atlasVPN. The data also shows a rise in emergency requests issued by the countries.

## Skills learned: 
That book knowledge is indeed different from practical knowledge, and this assignment is a prime example of that. I learned and relearned the basics of analyzing in Pandas, using GitHub and visualization in Datawrapper during this assignment. I also learned to find interesting data sets that are available to the public and make sense of them using pandas. 

## Things I would've liked to do:
I would like to strengthen my analysis capabilities and be able to ask the dataset more complex questions. I truly believe that will only happen when I continue to practice pandas while I wipe the tears that roll down my cheeks cause I am unable to find that one error that is ruining my whole day. (Thank you, TAs)
