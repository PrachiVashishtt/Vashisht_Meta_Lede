                Recent data indicates that over 400k data requests were sent in 2022 to Meta, the internet corporation that controls Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. This comes as the firm continues to reduce, remove, and report harmful content on its social media platforms, especially after facing criticism for hosting misinformation. In 2022, law enforcement globally submitted 76,802 data requests to Meta asking for information on 827,927 users. Despite Meta's assurances that it has stringent regulations and procedures in place for such requests, the increase in government requests may potentially point to laxer oversight.             </p>

                </h3>
            <p>
                America's data requests in 2020 totaled 61,528; these included 3618 emergency demands and 57910 legal requests. The same year, 2186 emergency requests and 33374 requests were submitted by India, a nation where Facebook has served as a constant forum for hate speech. Germany and France take the next spots on the list with over 11,000 requests each.             </p>

            <p>
                While America and India continue to be top government requests countries in the data, Argentina’s requests rise from 1,624 in 2020 to 3538 in 2022, making it among the top 10 countries to request user data from Meta. Countries like Turkey, Poland, and United Kingdom also featured in the top requesters. A brief research by atlasVPN, also indicates that Meta disclosed at least some data in response to 76.45% of all requests. Furthermore, since 2013, the firm has received a total of 2,247,594 government requests for 3,629,299 user accounts globally.            </p>

        <h3>What do these requests mean for your data?
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Data requests from Meta fall under the legal, emergency, and preservation requests category. Legal requests are those requests which are accompanied by legal processes, like a search warrant. On the other hand, emergency requests can be submitted without a legal process and Meta may voluntarily disclose information on matters that involve the risk of serious physical injury or death. When a preservation request is made, the company saves a temporary snapshot of the pertinent account information, but will not disclose any of the preserved records unless and until they receive a valid legal process.            </p>
            <p>
                While transparency reports by big tech companies are labeled as a way to ensure safe, operations, recent research shows that most companies only follow partial guidelines while processing them. Additionally, these reports are often published only in English, which makes them less accessible for all of Meta’s users globally. Although it is hard to say what specifically the government is looking for in these data, it is about time we become vigilant about our social media habits.             <br><br>
